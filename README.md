# COVID-19 Tracking App

This project is a part of SOEN 390 - Software Engineering Team Design Project - at Concordia University. The project aims to build a system that could facilitate the tracking of COVID-19 patients' status in Canada. In addition, the system also allow healthcare professionals to give advice to patients regarding the status of their symptoms.

# Sprint 1

[Sprint 1 Report](https://github.com/SamanthaGuillemette/SOEN390/blob/main/wiki_docs/Sprint_Reports/SOEN390-Sprint_1_Report_Team14.pdf)

1. [ User Stories Backlog (USB) ](https://github.com/SamanthaGuillemette/SOEN390/blob/main/wiki_docs/USB/Team14_User%20Story%20Backlog.xlsx)
   ```diff
   - The login signup fuctions are assigned in Sprint2. However they are in progressing right now.
   - Perhaps you can move login signup to sprint1. So that the runable app for sprint1 is a complete system.
   - We will check whether the document and runable app is consistent with the user sotries. (The backend code and database is not needed in sprint1)
   ```
3. [ Release Plan (Sprint #2 planning) ](https://github.com/SamanthaGuillemette/SOEN390/blob/main/wiki_docs/Release_Plan/Release%20Plan%20-%20Spint%202%20Planning.xlsx)
   ```diff
   - Please finish a release plan according to the template required by the course 
   - Our TAs still DO NOT know how students are to submit their documentations. One of our TAs has asked Prof this question.
   - I GUESS the professor will ask for docs in excel sheet or word which are easy to save and transfer.
   - So, it would be much better if your team provides excell sheet or word docs for USB, Release plan, SAD, RMP, testing plan. 
   - For UI prototypes, maybe you can also copy/export them to a word after you finished them.
   - In a word, Prof. MAY ask for docs in excel or word for all diliverables if possible.
   ```
   
4. Software Architecture Document (SAD) (See Sprint 1 Report)
      ```diff
   - Please finish a SAD according to the template required by the course 
   - Our TAs still DO NOT know how to evaluate your work. One of our TAs has asked Prof this question.
   - As for me, I will evalute your work according to the "Evaluation scheme" in the course plan. 
   - Your work on the tool is one part and the document is another part (I will evaluate both of them).
   - My suggestion is that, please finish your docs (word or excel sheet) COMPLETE like the SAD example.pdf (iCare System Architecture Design).
   - At least, a cover page for the word is needed. 
   ```
6. Risk Assessment & Risk Management Plan (RMP) (See Sprint 1 Report)
7. [ UI prototypes for Sprint #1 user stories ](https://github.com/SamanthaGuillemette/SOEN390/tree/main/wiki_docs/UI_Prototypes/Sprint%201/Admin)
8. [ UI prototypes for Sprint #2 user stories ](https://github.com/SamanthaGuillemette/SOEN390/tree/main/wiki_docs/UI_Prototypes/Sprint%202)
9. Testing Plan (See Sprint 1 Report)
   ```diff
   - Perhaps you can refer to the template required by the course, adding Integration tests    System tests 
   ```
10. Running prototype
11. [Short sprint retrospective](https://github.com/SamanthaGuillemette/SOEN390/blob/main/wiki_docs/Sprint_Retrospectives/Team14_ShortSprint1Retrospective.pdf)
