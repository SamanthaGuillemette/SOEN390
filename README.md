# COVID-19 Tracking App

This project is a part of SOEN 390 - Software Engineering Team Design Project - at Concordia University. The project aims to build a system that could facilitate the tracking of COVID-19 patients' status in Canada. In addition, the system also allow healthcare professionals to give advice to patients regarding the status of their symptoms.

# Sprint 1

[Sprint 1 Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1esurqtZa8eODruQXJ0F_BawF2JGl0_qDkZ_lG9hPVZQ/edit?usp=sharing)

1. [ User Stories Backlog (USB) ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v1IFZS3l6tXjasTQJg2tO4MBA1YRNO6LSYgqzRlajYo/edit?usp=sharing)
   ```diff
   - The login signup fuctions are assigned in Sprint2. However they are in progressing right now.
   - Perhaps you can move login signup to sprint1. So that the runable app for sprint1 is a complete system.
   - We will check whether the document and runable app is consistent with the user sotries. (The backend code and database is not needed in sprint1)
   ```
3. [ Release Plan (Sprint #2 planning) ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-6o-qoXKSxPfk3hd5cQIkJZPj7nSLO8m/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=100930122855963616065&rtpof=true&sd=true)
   ```diff
   - Please finish a release plan according to the template required by the course 
   - Our TAs still DO NOT know how students are to submit their documentations. One of our TAs has asked Prof this question.
   - I GUESS the professor will ask for docs in excel sheet or word which are easy to save and transfer.
   - So, it would be much better if your team provides excell sheet or word docs for USB, Release plan, SAD, RMP, testing plan. 
   - For UI prototypes, maybe you can also copy/export them to a word after you finished them.
   - In a word, Prof. MAY ask for docs in excel or word for all diliverables if possible.
   ```
   
4. [ Software Architecture Document (SAD) ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GY1IvEYwWEVAVs94CYUvV-9cpSw9zaF6/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=100930122855963616065&rtpof=true&sd=true)
      ```diff
   - Please finish a SAD according to the template required by the course 
   - Our TAs still DO NOT know how to evaluate your work. One of our TAs has asked Prof this question.
   - As for me, I will evalute your work according to the "Evaluation scheme" in the course plan. 
   - Your work on the tool is one part and the document is another part (I will evaluate both of them).
   - My suggestion is that, please finish your docs (word or excel sheet) COMPLETE like the SAD example.pdf (iCare System Architecture Design).
   - At least, a cover page for the word is needed. 
   ```

   ```diff
   - Perhaps you can refer to the template required by the course, adding Integration tests    System tests 
   ```
